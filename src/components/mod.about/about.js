            Hi, my name is Irma Guerrero and have been interested in  essential oils but never really knew what company to go with as it was an area of the unknown. Five  plus years ago, I became acquainted with friends who were using essential oils and started learning about the health benefits of essential oils.  I  was also  introduced to the essential oil company called Young Living.  This company produces their essential oils on their own farms organically and each small bottle of essential oil is 100 percent pure from the growing from a seed to the seal on the essential oil bottle.  I even became a member of  Young Living 5 years ago and have never looked back.  The essential oils are a very significant part of our familyâ€™s life now.  We supplement our health with these oils for a variety of health issues like allergies, pain management,  upset stomach,  upper respiratory,  insect bites, burns,  cuts, oral care, joint pain, and  sleeping, or just for the calming aroma itself.  Check out the web page and follow the links as they lead you to the Young Living way of life.
