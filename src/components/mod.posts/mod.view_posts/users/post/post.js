COPAIBA - This oil is found in lots of products such as Stress Away, Deep Relief, and Cool Azul Pain Cream... yep, it‚Äôs definitely great to rub on achy joints and muscles. It‚Äôs also a Vitality oil (exact same oil but different label), so a few drops in some NingXia Red each day or even a capsule full along with some Sulfurzyme and NingXia is great to support the body‚Äôs immune system.

LAVENDER - The ‚ÄúSwiss Army Knife‚Äù of essential oils. We use it for EVERYTHING... relaxation, soothing skin... Oh! And it‚Äôs in Lavaderm After-Sun spray which is great for minor burns, cuts and scrapes!

CLARY SAGE - Let‚Äôs look at the blends this is in to see why I love it for my skin and as a mood-enhancer: Dragon Time, Sclaressence, and Lady Sclareol. After cleaning and toning your face, this is a great oil to apply before moisturizing, 

RUTAVALA - You may be more familiar with this in a roller bottle size, but I‚Äôm excited about using this gem in the diffuser! It‚Äôs the top oil for sleep for a lot of people. The rue, valerian, and lavender combination helps relax and calm the brain before bed. When I first smelled this blend about a decade ago, it was not my favorite. While it‚Äôs grown on me over the years, I just apply it to my feet or layer it with something I do like to smell. This is one of my oldest daughter‚Äôs favorite blends as she uses it when she feels anxious. She rubs it on her wrists and on the back of her neck at the base of her skull and immediately calms and relaxes. It‚Äôs amazing!!!

BLUE CYPRESS - Winter is nearly over, but the effects on our skin can last into Spring. If your face needs some extra attention, add a drop to your moisturizer or more to the Dry Skin Serum (it already contains BC plus Cedarwood, Lavender, Myrrh, Clove, and Royal Hawaiian Sandalwood). To spread the love, put a few drops in your bottle of Genesis Lotion to soothe skin all over.  

IDAHO GRAND FIR - Open this bottle and be transported to the undefiled forests of northern Idaho. It‚Äôs one of several conifers from the Highland Flats Farm and Distillery. And back in 2013, I had the privilege of working with Gary Young on that Farm to harvest Idaho Grand Fir during Winter Harvest. Add this to your free Copaiba and slather it on tired muscles for a relaxing and invigorating pampering.

AMETHYST ROLLER - This beautiful stone is a lovely partner for oils that encourage balance, creativity, and confidence.`,

            `5 ways to use Peace and Calming
            
It‚Äôs all in the name. Peace & Calming¬Æ is a must-have to create peaceful, relaxing feelings, no matter what time of the day it is. Grounding oils like Patchouli and Ylang Ylang give this blend its ability to create a calm environment, where you can feel centered and at peace.

Tangerine, Orange, Ylang Ylang, Patchouli, and Blue Tansy come together to create the sweet, comforting aroma of Peace & Calming. The aroma is a perfect combination of floral and citrus notes. It‚Äôs no surprise why this blend is a well-known companion for evening routines and moments of zen.

How do you use Peace and Calming?

‚Ä¢ Provide a peaceful aroma when doing yoga and meditating by applying it you‚Äôre the bottom of your feet, along your neck, or diffusing.

‚Ä¢ Apply it to your temples and neck to harness feelings of balance.

‚Ä¢ Pack it in your travel bag to help with sleep schedule adjustments or stressors.

‚Ä¢ Finish your day with a relaxing massage by combing it with your favorite carrier oil.

‚Ä¢ Have crazy, rambunctious kids? Try filling a 16oz stainless steel spray bottle with water and add around 10-15 drops of Peace and Calming. As your kids are running and playing, try squirting their clothing and backs for a more calm and peaceful environment.

If you haven‚Äôt tried this amazing oil, do yourself a favor and get a 15 ml bottle for free this month with every 300 PV order. Peace and Calming is not sold in a 15 ml bottle, so make sure to grab it while you can!`,

            `You can create an uplifting, positive, and joyful atmosphere in your home simply by diffusing essential oils.

Diffusing essential oils is one of the most powerful ways to enjoy their benefits! Aromas are processed in the body before we are consciously aware of it, and they can set the mood and atmosphere in any environment.

The sense of smell is directly connected to the limbic lobe of your brain, also known as the emotional control center. The limbic lobe is responsible for your mood, memory, behavior, feelings, and emotions, and it is connected to the olfactory bulb in the nose. When a scent arrives to the limbic system, your body responds by releasing unique chemicals into your brain, causing different reactions, depending on the aromas detected.

The same concept applies to aromas from essential oils! The sense of smell can have a profound impact on your emotions and inner desires. During these slow cold winter months, diffuse oils that can help to create an uplifting atmosphere! 

Some of our favorites are:

‚Ä¢ Joy: Creates a joyful and happy aromatic experience when applied to wrists or heart

‚Ä¢ Lemon: Diffuse it at work or school for a bright aroma that creates a sense of focus and motivation. Lemon essential oil has a cheerful, sweet aroma that can freshen and fill your home with its clean, lemon-drop scent when diffused.

‚Ä¢ Lime: If you‚Äôre feeling uninspired, try diffusing Lime oil for a bright, refreshing aroma that may clear a path to greater creativity.

‚Ä¢ Stress Away: Fill your workspace with a sweet, calming aroma that will encourage you to breathe deeply and relax.

‚Ä¢ Grapefruit: Grapefruit has a fresh, invigorating aroma that encourages feelings of joy, satisfaction, and playfulness. Instantly brighten our kitchen, living room, or office by diffusing its citrus scent

‚Ä¢ Jade Lemon: Diffuse to uplift and stimulate the mind and body.

‚Ä¢ Citrus Fresh: Infuse joy and creativity into children's playtime by diffusing Citrus Fresh.

‚Ä¢ Orange: Start your day with an uplifting burst of liquid sunshine by diffusing Orange as you get ready in the morning.`,
